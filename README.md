# personal_page
Almost all of the JS added to this page is for event handlers, either on click or on hover. Within the event handler logic are some of the basic programming concepts we've gone over in class, including functions, for loops, and switch statements. There is also DOM manipulation, as most of the event handlers are adding or removing classes/IDs from exisitng elements to change appearance. For the photo gallery, DOM manipulation is used to change out the image sources for the larger display. 

While this project isnt super heavy on JS code, I deicded that I would rather have a more complete website including plenty of CSS and HTML, as I ultimately would like to get my own site hosted to show to potential future employers. As this site currently sits it is not a finished product, which is why I have not hosted it. Down the line I would like to integrate some of the projects from this and other classes directly into the site so it is more of a portfolio than a resume/about me site. 


JS elements added: 

* progress bar -> this is pulled from the book, but just wanted something easy to start off with. displays a green progress bar at the top of the screen that fills as you scroll down

* hover shadows -> adds IDs to elements using JS which adds a shadow when hovered from CSS

* pic zooms -> zooms in on a couple of pictures upon hover, using DOM and event handler

* dropdown -> defaults to hidden, uses event handler and DOM tree to add a class to display/close the list on click

*photo gallery -> click on one of the gallery pictures to see a larger version. this again uses the DOM but instead of adding/removing a class/id it changes the source file of the larger image to match the one the user has clicked most recently. it also starts the gallery pictures as a little opaque before removing that when hovering.
